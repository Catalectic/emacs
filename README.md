My Emacs configuration files. Of particular notice:

* The package setup system, which caches the list of currently installed packages on every start, allowing for very 
easy migrations between computers.
* Ruby is set up to use auto-complete through the Robe package, with Web-Mode providing support for embedded Ruby files.
* Ace-Jump is really nifty to move around buffers or between windows.
